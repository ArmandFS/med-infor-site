# med-infor-site
This project is a small front-end only website for an event called "Biomedical Engineering Workshop". I present this website for the sole purposes of giving knowledge to peole about the Medical Informatics Branch in my biomedical engineering major in ITS. Currently only using HTML, CSS and Javascript. I'm sure other frameworks can be handy. I will be uploading this shortly. Will up this to LinkedIn probably.
